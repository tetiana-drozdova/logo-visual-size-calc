Situation:
Help the designer align logos by their visual size.

Task:
Make a tool that will calculate and compare the area of two given rectangles - giving length and width values for the second one so that its area coincides with the first, original rectangle.

Action:
Was made a calculator that calculates the area value of the first and second logos. Then compares them and calculates the coefficients for the size of the sides by which they must be increased or decreased. As a result, it gives the new values of length and width for the second logo so that its area corresponds to the first logo.

Result:
The designer has a simple tool where you enter the length and width of the two logos and the calculator gives you the values of length and width for the second logo so that its area corresponds to the first logo.
